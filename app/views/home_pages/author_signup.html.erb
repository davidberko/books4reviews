      <div id="rules" ><p>Here's how it works. You make your book on Amazon permanently free by
        listing it on other platforms like Smashwords and elsewhere for free and telling
        Amazon you see it free on those sites or by going into your KDP account and making it
        free (temporarily)...that way reviewers "purchase" your book at no charge to them but their Amazon
        review is still a verified Amazon purchase review, the best kind of review to help your
        sales out. Pretty simple, right?</p>
